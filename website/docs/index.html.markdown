# TencentCloud Provider

The TencentCloud provider is used to interact with many resources supported by [TencentCloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com).
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation on the left to read about the available resources.

-> **Note:** Terraform 0.12.x supported began with provider version 1.9.0 (June 18, 2019).

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    tencentcloud = {
      source = "tencentcloudstack/tencentcloud"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the TencentCloud Provider
provider "tencentcloud" {
  secret_id  = "my-secret-id"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
  region     = "ap-guangzhou"
}

# Get availability zones
data "tencentcloud_availability_zones" "default" {}

# Get availability images
data "tencentcloud_images" "default" {
  image_type = ["PUBLIC_IMAGE"]
  os_name    = "centos"
}

# Get availability instance types
data "tencentcloud_instance_types" "default" {
  cpu_core_count = 1
  memory_size    = 1
}

# Create a web server
resource "tencentcloud_instance" "web" {
  instance_name              = "web server"
  availability_zone          = data.tencentcloud_availability_zones.default.zones.0.name
  image_id                   = data.tencentcloud_images.default.images.0.image_id
  instance_type              = data.tencentcloud_instance_types.default.instance_types.0.instance_type
  system_disk_type           = "CLOUD_PREMIUM"
  system_disk_size           = 50
  allocate_public_ip         = true
  internet_max_bandwidth_out = 20
  security_groups            = [tencentcloud_security_group.default.id]
  count                      = 1
}

# Create security group
resource "tencentcloud_security_group" "default" {
  name        = "web accessibility"
  description = "make it accessible for both production and stage ports"
}

# Create security group rule allow web request
resource "tencentcloud_security_group_rule" "web" {
  security_group_id = tencentcloud_security_group.default.id
  type              = "ingress"
  cidr_ip           = "0.0.0.0/0"
  ip_protocol       = "tcp"
  port_range        = "80,8080"
  policy            = "accept"
}

# Create security group rule allow ssh request
resource "tencentcloud_security_group_rule" "ssh" {
  security_group_id = tencentcloud_security_group.default.id
  type              = "ingress"
  cidr_ip           = "0.0.0.0/0"
  ip_protocol       = "tcp"
  port_range        = "22"
  policy            = "accept"
}
```

## Authentication

The TencentCloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication.
The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables
- Assume role
- Assume role with SAML
- Assume role with OIDC
- Shared credentials
- Enable pod OIDC
- Cam role name

### Static credentials

!> **Warning:** Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not
recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a
public version control system.

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `secret_id` `secret_key` and `region` in-line in the tencentcloud provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  secret_id  = "my-secret-id"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
  region     = "ap-guangzhou"
}
```

Use `allowed_account_ids` or `forbidden_account_ids`

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  secret_id  = "my-secret-id"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
  region     = "ap-guangzhou"

  allowed_account_ids   = ["100023201586", "100023201349"]
}
```

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  secret_id  = "my-secret-id"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
  region     = "ap-guangzhou"

  forbidden_account_ids = ["100023201223"]
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials via `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID` and `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY` environment variables,
representing your TencentCloud Secret Id and Secret Key respectively. `TENCENTCLOUD_REGION` is also used, if applicable:

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {}
```

Usage:

```shell
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID="my-secret-id"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY="my-secret-key"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_REGION="ap-guangzhou"
$ terraform plan
```

### Assume role

If provided with an assume role, Terraform will attempt to assume this role using the supplied credentials. Assume role can be provided by adding an `role_arn`, `session_name`, `session_duration`, `policy`(optional) and `external_id`(optional) in-line in the tencentcloud provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  secret_id  = "my-secret-id"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
  region     = "ap-guangzhou"

  assume_role {
    role_arn         = "my-role-arn"
    session_name     = "my-session-name"
    policy           = "my-role-policy"
    session_duration = 3600
  }
}
```

The `role_arn`, `session_name`, `session_duration` and `external_id` can also provided via `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_ARN`, `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_NAME`, `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_DURATION` and `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_EXTERNAL_ID` environment variables.

Usage:

```shell
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID="my-secret-id"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY="my-secret-key"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_REGION="ap-guangzhou"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_ARN="my-role-arn"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_NAME="my-session-name"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_DURATION=3600
$ terraform plan
```

### Assume role with SAML

If provided with an assume role with SAML, Terraform will attempt to assume this role using the supplied credentials. Assume role can be provided by adding an `role_arn`, `session_name`, `session_duration`, `saml_assertion` and `principal_arn` in-line in the tencentcloud provider block:

-> **Note:** Assume-role-with-SAML is a no-AK auth type, and there is no need setting secret_id and secret_key while using it.

Usage:

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  assume_role_with_saml {
    role_arn         = "my-role-arn"
    session_name     = "my-session-name"
    session_duration = 3600
    saml_assertion   = "my-saml-assertion"
    principal_arn    = "my-principal-arn"
  }
}
```

The `role_arn`, `session_name`, `session_duration`, `saml_assertion`, `principal_arn` can also provided via `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_ARN`, `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_NAME`, `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_DURATION`, `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SAML_ASSERTION` and `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_PRINCIPAL_ARN` environment variables.

Usage:

```shell
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_ARN="my-role-arn"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_NAME="my-session-name"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_DURATION=3600
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SAML_ASSERTION="my-saml-assertion"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_PRINCIPAL_ARN="my-principal-arn"
$ terraform plan
```

### Assume role with OIDC

If provided with an assume role with OIDC, Terraform will attempt to assume this role using the supplied credentials. Assume role can be provided by adding an `role_arn`, `session_name`, `session_duration` and `web_identity_token` in-line in the tencentcloud provider block:

-> **Note:** Assume-role-with-OIDC is a no-AK auth type, and there is no need setting secret_id and secret_key while using it.

Usage:

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  assume_role_with_web_identity {
    provider_id        = "OIDC"
    role_arn           = "my-role-arn"
    session_name       = "my-session-name"
    session_duration   = 3600
    web_identity_token = "my-web-identity-token"
  }
}
```

The `provider_id`, `role_arn`, `session_name`, `session_duration`, `web_identity_token` can also provided via `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_PROVIDER_ID`, `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_ARN`, `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_NAME`, `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_DURATION` and `TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN` environment variables.

Usage:

```shell
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID="my-secret-id"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY="my-secret-key"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_DURATION=3600
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN="my-web-identity-token"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_ASSUME_ROLE_PROVIDER_ID="OIDC"
$ terraform plan
```

### Enable pod OIDC

Configure the TencentCloud Provider with TKE OIDC.

-> **Note:** Must ensure CAM OIDC provider and WEBHOOK component are created successfully.

Usage:

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  enable_pod_oidc = true
}
```

### Cam role name

If provided with a Cam role name, Terraform will just access the metadata URL: `http://metadata.tencentyun.com/latest/meta-data/cam/security-credentials/<cam_role_name>` to obtain the STS credential. The CVM Instance Role also can be set using the `TENCENTCLOUD_CAM_ROLE_NAME` environment variables.

-> **Note:** Cam-role-name is used to grant the role entity the permissions to access services and resources and perform operations in Tencent Cloud. You can associate the CAM role with a CVM instance to call other Tencent Cloud APIs from the instance using the periodically updated temporary Security Token Service (STS) key.

-> **Note:** Cam-role-name is a no-AK auth type, and there is no need setting secret_id and secret_key while using it.

Usage:

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  cam_role_name = "my-cam-role-name"
}
```

It can also be authenticated together with method Assume role. Authentication process: Perform CAM authentication first, then proceed with Assume role authentication.

Usage:

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  cam_role_name = "my-cam-role-name"

  assume_role {
    role_arn         = "my-role-arn"
    session_name     = "my-session-name"
    policy           = "my-role-policy"
    session_duration = 3600
    external_id      = "my-external-id"
  }
}
```

### CDC cos usage

You can set the cos domain by setting the environment variable `TENCENTCLOUD_COS_DOMAIN`, and configure the cdc scenario as follows:

-> **Note:** Please note that not all cos resources are supported. Please pay attention to the prompts for each resource.

```hcl
locals {
  region = "ap-guangzhou"
  cdc_id = "cluster_xxx"
}

provider "tencentcloud" {
  region     = local.region
  secret_id  = "my-secret-id"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
  cos_domain = "https://${local.cdc_id}.cos-cdc.${local.region}.myqcloud.com/"
}
```

The `cos_domain` can also provided via `TENCENTCLOUD_COS_DOMAIN` environment variables.

Usage:

```shell
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID="my-secret-id"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY="my-secret-key"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_REGION="ap-guangzhou"
$ export TENCENTCLOUD_COS_DOMAIN="https://cluster-xxxxxx.cos-cdc.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/"
$ terraform plan
```

### Shared credentials

You can use [Tencent Cloud credentials](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1013/33464) to specify your credentials. The default location is `$HOME/.tccli` on Linux and macOS, And `"%USERPROFILE%\.tccli"` on Windows. You can optionally specify a different location in the Terraform configuration by providing the `shared_credentials_dir` argument or using the `TENCENTCLOUD_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_DIR` environment variable. This method also supports a `profile` configuration and matching `TENCENTCLOUD_PROFILE` environment variable:

Usage:

On Linux/MacOS

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  shared_credentials_dir = "/Users/tf_user/.tccli"
  profile                = "default"
}
```

On Windows

```hcl
provider "tencentcloud" {
  shared_credentials_dir = "C:\\Users\\tf_user\\.tccli"
  profile                = "default"
}
```
