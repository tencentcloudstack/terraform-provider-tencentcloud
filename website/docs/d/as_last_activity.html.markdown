# tencentcloud_as_last_activity

Use this data source to query detailed information of AS last activity

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "tencentcloud_as_last_activity" "example" {
  auto_scaling_group_ids     = ["asg-3st9wq9m"]
  exclude_cancelled_activity = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `auto_scaling_group_ids` - (Required, Set: [`String`]) ID list of an auto scaling group.
* `exclude_cancelled_activity` - (Optional, Bool) Exclude cancellation type activities when querying. The default value is false, indicating that cancellation type activities are not excluded.
* `result_output_file` - (Optional, String) Used to save results.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `activity_set` - Information set of eligible scaling activities. Scaling groups without scaling activities are not returned. For example, if there are 50 auto scaling group IDs but only 45 records are returned, it indicates that 5 of the auto scaling groups do not have scaling activities.
  * `activity_id` - Scaling activity ID.
  * `activity_related_instance_set` - Information set of the instances related to the scaling activity.
    * `instance_id` - Instance ID.
    * `instance_status` - Status of the instance in the scaling activity. Value range: INIT, RUNNING, SUCCESSFUL, FAILED.
