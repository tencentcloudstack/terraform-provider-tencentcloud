# tencentcloud_emr_nodes

Provides an available EMR for the user.

The EMR data source obtain the hardware node information by using the emr cluster ID.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "tencentcloud_emr_nodes" "my_emr_nodes" {
  node_flag   = "master"
  instance_id = "emr-rnzqrleq"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `instance_id` - (Required, String) Cluster instance ID, the instance ID is as follows: emr-xxxxxxxx.
* `node_flag` - (Required, String) Node ID, the value is:
				- all: Means to get all type nodes, except cdb information.
				- master: Indicates that the master node information is obtained.
				- core: Indicates that the core node information is obtained.
				- task: indicates obtaining task node information.
				- common: means to get common node information.
				- router: Indicates obtaining router node information.
				- db: Indicates that the cdb information for the normal state is obtained.
				- recyle: Indicates that the node information in the Recycle Bin isolation, including the cdb information, is obtained.
				- renew: Indicates that all node information to be renewed, including cddb information, is obtained, and the auto-renewal node will not be returned.
				
				Note: Only the above values are now supported, entering other values will cause an error.
* `hardware_resource_type` - (Optional, String) Resource type: Support all/host/pod, default is all.
* `limit` - (Optional, Int) The number returned per page, the default value is 100, and the maximum value is 100.
* `offset` - (Optional, Int) Page number, with a default value of 0, represents the first page.
* `result_output_file` - (Optional, String) Used to save results.
